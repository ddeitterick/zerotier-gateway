## zerotier-gateway

#### Description

This container is based on a lightweight Alpine Linux image and a copy of ZeroTier One. It was primarily designed to run on a Synology NAS and function as a gateway between your local network and ZeroTier network(s). It will run on other amd64-based machines.

The container uses a macvlan network. One of the side effects of using macvlan is that the container canâ€™t access the host, and vice versa. Because of this an additional "bridge" network is used so that ZeroTier clients can access the Synology NAS. Make sure that this network is already created in Docker before performing the steps below.

#### Run

To run this container in the correct way requires some special options to give it special permissions and allow it to persist its files. Here's an example:

    docker create 
      --restart always \
      --network macvlan1 \
      --ip=192.168.1.254 \
      -p 9993:9993/udp \
      --name zerotier-gateway \
      --device=/dev/net/tun \
      --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
      -v /volume1/docker/zerotier-gateway/zerotier-one:/var/lib/zerotier-one \
      -v /volume1/docker/zerotier-gateway/iptables:/etc/iptables \
      -e NETWORK_IDS="[ZT_NETWORK_ID1;ZT_NETWORK_ID2]" \
      -e DOCKER_HOST="[HOST_IP]" \
      ddeitterick/zerotier-gateway

The environment variable `DOCKER_HOST` specifies the IP address of the computer running Docker (Synology NAS in my example). You will then need to connect the "bridge" network (referenced as bridge-zerotier-gateway in the command below) to the Docker container so that ZeroTier clients can access the Synology NAS IP address:

    docker network connect bridge-zerotier-gateway zerotier-gateway

Finally, you can then start the container:

    docker start zerotier-gateway

This runs ddeitterick/zerotier-gateway in a container exposed on the physical network (i.e. it has its own IP on the local network) via a macvlan interface. More details on macvlan networks and Docker can be found in the references section below. An example of how you can create a macvlan network in Docker is shown below:

    docker network create \
      --driver macvlan \
      --gateway 192.168.1.1 \
      --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
      -o parent=ovs_bond0 \
      macvlan1

It also mounts /volume1/docker/zerotier-gateway/zerotier-one to /var/lib/zerotier-one and /volume1/docker/zerotier-gateway/iptables to /etc/iptables inside the container, allowing your service container to persist its state across restarts of the container itself. If you don't do this it'll generate a new identity every time. You can put the actual data somewhere other than /volume1/docker/zerotier-gateway if you want.

To join one or more ZeroTier networks, you can specify the network ids in the environment variable `NETWORK_IDS` (semi-colon delimited).

To configure as a gateway and to provide network address translation (NAT) for ZeroTier clients accessing services behind the gateway on the local network, you may need to complete a couple of additional tasks:

1) Make sure ip forwarding (net.ipv4.ip_forward=1) is enabled on the Synology NAS and stored in /etc/sysctl.conf (to make it persistent) before starting the container. (The startup script will check for this and terminate the container if ip forwarding is disabled.)
2) Create the necessary static route(s) for either the ZeroTier network and/or the local network. Static route settings for ZeroTier networks are found in the ZeroTier Central website (https://my.zerotier.com) and you can configure static route(s) for your local network in your home router/gateway admin website.
3) Iptables is used to provide NAT for ZeroTier clients accessing services behind the gateway on the local network. You will need to create a rules.v4 file and place it in /etc/iptables. When the container starts, iptables will import whatever rules are contained in this file.

An example rules.v4 file is shown below:

    *nat
    -A PREROUTING -d 10.x.x.x -j DNAT --to-destination 192.x.x.x
    -A PREROUTING -d 10.x.x.y -j DNAT --to-destination 192.x.x.y
    -I POSTROUTING -o ztXXXXXXXX -j MASQUERADE
    -I POSTROUTING -o ztYYYYYYYY -j MASQUERADE
    -I POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
    -I POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
